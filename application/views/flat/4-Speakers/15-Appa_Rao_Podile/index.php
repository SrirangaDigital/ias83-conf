                <strong>Appa Rao Podile,</strong> University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, elected to Fellowship in 2015.
                Podile is interested in plantâ€“microbe interactions. His research group focuses on molecular
                interactions of rhizosphere bacteria with plants. In the past decade, domain shuf-
                fling/swapping of recombinant bacterial chitinases, bioprocess development for production
                of chitooligosaccharides by enzymatic methods, mechanism of elicitor (harpin) induced
                cell death, nanotechnology for crop protection, and non-host resistance have been his major
                areas of research interest. He is a recipient of Tata Innovation Fellowship from DBT.

                    Plants interact with a wide range of pathogens and have evolved mechanisms to recognize
                    pathogen-derived molecules to elicit induced resistance. Unlike vertebrate animals, plants
                    rely solely on innate immunityto ward off pathogenic microbes. The plants are able to sense
                    evolutionarily conserved general elicitors of pathogens called pathogen-associated molecular
                    patterns, and activate immune responses, a process that is known as pathogen-triggered
                    immunity. Chitooligosaccharides (COS), released during plant fungal interaction, elicit
                    plant defense upon recognition. In this talk, the progress made towards understanding the
                    mechanism of COS sensing in plants and on the application of chitin/chitosan/COS in disease
                    management would be focused. As the plants are able to recognize the chitin/chitosan
                    oligomers and activate defense responses, there has been an increased interest in the use of
                    chitin and chitosan in agriculture. Transglycosylation (TG) of short chain COS resulting
                    in long chain COS, with the use of chitinases, holds promise. To realize such a potential,
                    sources of chitinases have been identified in our lab. The talk would cover the efforts made
                    in our lab to understand/improve TG by selected bacterial chitinase(s) with an interest to
                    generate longer chain COS.
