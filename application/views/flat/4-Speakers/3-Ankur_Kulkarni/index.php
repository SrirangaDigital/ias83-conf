                <p class="abstract">
                    A fundamental problem in stochastic control and information theory is to provide tight
                    lower bounds on the minimum cost attainable in a system. This problem is theoretically
                    well understood under classical settings those that assume infinite memory but is plagued
                    by a lack of tools for attack in nonclassical settings. We explain this phase change from
                    convex-analytic perspectives and develop new attacks on this problem. We argue that common
                    to such settings is a fundamental nonconvexity that germinates from the nonclassicality
                    of the information structure. Using convex relaxations and linear programming duality we
                    obtain tight lower bounds for problems studied in information theory. This work hopes to
                    derive a convex-analytic means of understanding problems with various information structures.
