                    Growing anisotropic nanostructures of high-symmetry materials is a challenging task
                    owing to the symmetry-breaking that is required. We have developed a simple wet chemical
                    method by which ultrathin (&lt; 2 nm diameter) Au nanowires could be grown in the solution
                    phase. In the first part of the talk, the details of the mechanism of these wires using electron
                    microscopy as the principal supporting tool will be discussed. In the second part, methods
                    to grow these wires on substrates and directly between pre-patterned contact pads will be
                    discussed. This enables the direct measurement of electrical transport through these wires
                    for the first time. An unexpected insulating behaviour in these wires with the resistivity
                    decreasing as a function of the temperature of measurement was found. The implications
                    of this observation will be discussed. In the third part, some intriguing results on the atomic
                    structure of these nanowires where we find modulations of atomic planes normal to the
                    growth directions will be presented. Finally, some interesting applications of these ultrathin
                    metal nanowires in sensing and catalysis will be presented.
