                <p class="title">Beyond the conventional DFT: Life with “U”</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    While the conventional density functional theory (DFT) within the framework of local
                    density approximation (LDA), or in its other flavor, generalized gradient approximation
                    (GGA), has been surprisingly successful in predicting the properties of most materials, it
                    fails in cases. Examples include <em>d</em>-electron-based transition metal oxides, or <em>f</em>-electron-based
                    rare-earth compounds, materials for which the Coulomb correlation, namely Hubbard
                    U, becomes important. The predictions of conventional DFT in these cases may turn
                    out to be quantitatively wrong. We will discuss the recent development in handling such
                    cases, thereby expanding the scope of DFT. The primary focus of this talk is on two major
                    developments, DFT+U and DFT+dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The effectiveness
                    of the methods will be demonstrated through applications in describing charge-ordered insulators
                    and correlated metals.
