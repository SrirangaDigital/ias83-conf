                <strong>Amitabh Joshi,</strong> Evolutionary &amp; Organismal Biology Unit, JNCASR, Bengaluru, elected to
                Fellowship in 2001. Joshi’s research interests include the evolution of life-histories; evolution
                of competitive ability and its consequences for population dynamics; small population
                and metapopulation dynamics and stability; the conceptual structure of evolutionary
                theory and the history and philosophical aspects of evolution and genetics. He has received
                the SS Bhatnagar Prize in Biology (2009) and the Young Leader in Science &amp; Technology
                (Laksmipat Singhania National Leadership Awards) (2010).

                <p class="title">Experimental ecology and evolution in the laboratory</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    It is often believed the ecological and evolutionary timescales are very different and that it is
                    difficult to study ecological and evolutionary processes together in a rigorous and controlled
                    manner. However, as the experience of the last few decades shows, experimental ecology
                    and evolution studies in laboratory settings provide us with the ability to rigorously examine
                    such phenomena and test hypotheses about evolutionary and ecological mechanisms, and
                    their interactions, in a manner that is not possible in the wild. In this talk, a few examples
                    from work in the speaker’s laboratory over the past twenty years will be used to illustrate
                    the power of this approach, and underscore the point that the evolutionary process is far
                    more subtle and responsive to minor changes in ecology than is often thought to be the
                    case.
