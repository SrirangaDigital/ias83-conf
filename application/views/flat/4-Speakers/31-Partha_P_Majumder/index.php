                <p class="abstract">
                    Only about 10% of cells associated with a human body are human cells; the remaining
                    90% are cells of microorganisms. In 2001, Joshua Lederberg coined the term microbiome
                    to “signify the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms
                    that literally share our body space and have been all but ignored as determinants of
                    health and disease”. The human microbiome contributes to our health and well-being, and
                    causes disease. In recent years, considerable understanding has emerged on the nature and
                    extent of human microbiome diversity. The understanding of the relationship of “our second
                    genome” with that of our own genome is just beginning to emerge. This Symposium
                    will focus on some recent advances.
