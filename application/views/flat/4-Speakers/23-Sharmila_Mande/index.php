                    Our body harbours ten times more microbes than our own cells. This microbial community
                    (called microbiome) is therefore expected to have huge influence on our health and wellbeing.
                    Metagenomics, an emerging field, is rapidly becoming the method of choice for
                    studying microbiomes present in various parts of the body. Recent studies have indicated
                    the role of gut microbiomes in several diseases/disorders and have also suggested their role
                    in nutrient absorption, immuno-modulation motor-response, and other key physiological
                    processes. Gut microbial communities have also been shown to act as reservoirs of antibiotic
                    resistance. In order to obtain biologically meaningful insights from the enormous
                    volume of microbiome data generated from sequencing platforms, it is necessary to have
                    appropriate analytics approaches. Efficient computational methodologies are needed for
                    management as well as analyses of the data. Some of the exciting outcomes from analytics
                    in a few selected gut microbiome studies will be highlighted during this talk.
