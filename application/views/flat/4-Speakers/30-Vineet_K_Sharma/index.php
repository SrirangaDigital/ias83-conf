                <strong>Vineet K Sharma,</strong> IISER, Bhopal. The current focus of Sharma’s lab is metagenomics and
                systems biology. His group has recently sequenced the gut and skin flora of several Indian
                individuals. They have also developed several software for metagenomic data analysis
                using machine learning methods and novel algorithms.

                <p class="title">Novel insights into the human microbiome</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Metagenomics has enabled us to access, in principle, nearly 100% of the microbial genomes
                    within an environment, something which has been unattainable using traditional methods.
                    It has revolutionized the genomic era and provided new insights by unlocking the massive
                    uncultured microbial diversity present in various environments including human gut
                    which particularly have unprecedented therapeutic, medical, and biotechnological applications.
                    The human gut harbours a diverse milieu of microbes which play a key role in
                    the well-being of the host. These micro-organisms are known to interact with one-another
                    and with the host immune system in various ways influencing the normal as well as diseased
                    states in the individuals. The gut microbiota metabolizes the substrate inputs from
                    the host such as diet and xenobiotics into metabolites which can affect the host and also
                    help in the metabolism of some complex nutritional compounds to simpler metabolites.
                    Therefore, variation in the gut flora is also known to occur largely as a cause or consequence
                    of many metabolic and immune-related disorders such as obesity, diabetes, IBD,
                    cardiovascular diseases, depression, etc. We have recently carried out several metagenomic
                    studies to examine the gut flora of healthy and diseased individuals in Indian population.
                    These studies have provided novel insights into the microbial communities associated with
                    Indian population. Furthermore, the metabolic analysis has revealed the novel metabolic
                    capabilities of human gut flora involved in the metabolism of different food substrates and
                    xenobiotics. The interesting findings from these studies will be presented.
