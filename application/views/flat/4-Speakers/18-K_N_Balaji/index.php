                <strong>K N Balaji,</strong> IISc, Bengaluru, elected to Fellowship in 2016. Balaji has worked on the
                immunological parameters associated with the interaction of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>
                (Mtb) with its host. His initial work focused on virulence-conferring PE proteins of
                Mtb. His work has also contributed to the identification of biomarkers associated with TB
                and spans varied aspects of immunology, including inflammatory disorders like arthritis
                and IBD. His is a recipient of the Sir C.V. Raman Young Scientist Karnataka State Award
                (2008), National Bioscience Award for Career Development (2009), Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar
                Prize (2011), JC Bose National Fellowship (2016), to name a few.

                <p class="title">Mycobacteria scapegoat host epigenetic factors and non-coding RNAs to sneak through host immune responses</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Infections with pathogenic mycobacteria are a global concern, with tuberculosis (TB),
                    caused by <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (Mtb), itself afflicting about one-third of the world
                    population. The success of the pathogen is due in part to its worthwhile co-evolution with
                    the host which allows it to flourish amidst a focused immune response. Alongside being
                    armed for self-defense, Mtb has also prudently garnered an armamentarium of mechanisms
                    to modulate host cellular machinery to its favour. Such strategies include generation of
                    regulatory T cells, compromising of host cell apoptosis, skewing of cytokine response, inhibition
                    of autophagy, generation of foamy macrophages, etc. Among the plethora of host
                    molecules being hijacked by Mtb to furnish the immune evasion strategies, fine tuning of
                    host epigenetic modifiers and non-coding RNAs like miRNAs serve as yet another line of
                    ammunition in its arsenal. In this context, the present talk will focus on the ability of Mtb to
                    strategize host miRNAs for inhibition of autophagy and to plant host epigenetic modifiers
                    for generation of foamy macrophages, so as to create a haven in the hostile environment
                    offered by the host.
