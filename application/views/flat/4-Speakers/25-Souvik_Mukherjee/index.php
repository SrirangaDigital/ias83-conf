                    The skin is the largest organ of the human body. The composition and abundance of the
                    skin commensal microbiome have direct implications in the maintenance of skin health.
                    Healthy skin microbiome is not same for all. Dysbiosis (microbiome imbalance) on the
                    skin is associated with chronic skin diseases. Past studies did not consider Asian/Indian individuals,
                    which is important since these populations have diverse population histories. The
                    speakers team has characterised the healthy facial skin microbiome in an Indian population
                    of Dravidian descent and derived evidence that inter-individual variability in microbiome
                    profile is significantly associated with sebum and hydration levels in specific facial regions.
                    The skin microbiome was found to be temporally stable even after one year. Microbiome
                    profile on the Indian skin is considerably different from that of the Caucasian skin, but is
                    less dissimilar from that of the Chinese skin. These findings are important in understanding
                    causes and differences in prevalence of various skin conditions like acne, psoriasis,
                    dermatitis, etc.
