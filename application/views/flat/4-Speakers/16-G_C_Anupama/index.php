                <strong>G C Anupama,</strong> , IIA, Bengaluru, elected to Fellowship in 2016. Anupama has expertise in
                the area of observational astronomy, in particular time domain astronomy. She specializes
                in the studies of eruptive transient variables. As a core member of the India TMT project,
                Anupama is responsible for the delivery of 90 polished segments of the primary mirror
                of the Thirty Meter Telescope, as a part of India’s in-kind contribution to the international
                project. She is a recipient of Government of Karnataka’s Sir C.V. Raman Young Scientist
                Award (2001).

                <p class="title">Time domain astronomy – Explosive transients</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Time domain astronomy is a study of the variable sky. There are several variable sources,
                    a good fraction of them being transient in nature. Some of the most energetic events in
                    the Universe are the explosive transients gamma-ray burst sources (GRBs), supernovae and
                    novae. GRBs and supernovae are the end stages of massive stars, while nova explosions are
                    a result of matter accretion onto a white dwarf. The observational properties of these source
                    will be described in this talk, using as examples the objects observed with the observing
                    facilities available in the country.
