                <p class="title">Chimeras: A spontaneous emergence of dynamical disorder</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Networks of identically coupled nonlinear oscillators can in some circumstances spontaneously  split into subgroups with different dynamical characteristics. In the simplest examples, there are two subgroups, one of which is fully synchronised while the other is desynchronised; more complex dynamical patterns are possible. Chimeras were first discovered in numerical studies, but have, in the past two decades, been seen in a number of experiments, and are believed to underlie interesting physiological states such as uni-hemispheric sleep that sea mammals and birds experience. Other situations where such states of broken symmetry may be relevant include ventricular fibrillation, and the so-called bump states in neural networks. The origin of the symmetry breaking that gives rise to such complex spatiotemporal patterns and the current interest in these phenomena will be discussed.
